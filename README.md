# Project H-Time: A Proof of Concept

 *A Proof of Concept for a personalized emergency guidance system*

---

## 1. Vision

**Project H-Time** is a global, personalized emergency guidance system designed to save lives during critical situations. Instead of providing generic warnings, our platform delivers a clear, actionable plan tailored to each user's specific location and the nature of the threat.

Our core philosophy is to transform chaos and panic into a controlled, step-by-step evacuation process, giving individuals a crucial sense of agency when they need it most.

## 2. Live Demonstration (Proof of Concept)

This repository contains a fully functional Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the core capabilities of our geo-analytical engine.

*(**Note:** This PoC is a "guided tour" and runs automatically for a consistent and impactful presentation.)*

The demonstration showcases three distinct, pre-scripted scenarios:
*   **Flood in Manhattan:** Simulates a response to rising water levels.
*   **Earthquake in California:** Simulates evacuation to a safe open assembly point.
*   **Tsunami in Florida:** Simulates evacuation from a coastal inundation zone to higher ground.

## 3. Key Value Points for Evaluation

We invite the jury to assess our project based on the following three pillars:

### üéØ Value (–¶–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å)
**Personalization is our core value.** The system doesn't just issue a warning; it provides a personalized context.
*   **User-Specific Data:** The dashboard displays the user's mock medical profile, demonstrating how this "last-mile" information can be critical for first responders.
*   **Location-Specific Instructions:** The system analyzes the user's precise location relative to the threat, providing clear, unambiguous guidance. We don't just say "evacuate," we show *where to* and *how*.

### ‚ú® Significance (–ó–Ω–∞—á–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å)
**We turn data into a life-saving plan.** The project's significance lies in its ability to synthesize complex data streams into a simple, actionable output.
*   **Multi-Source Data Aggregation (Simulated):** The PoC simulates aggregating data from various sources (e.g., meteorological, seismological) to model a threat zone in real-time.
*   **Dynamic Safe-Routing:** The geo-analytical engine calculates the safest evacuation route on the fly, demonstrating its capacity to navigate users around danger zones. This is the heart of our intellectual property.

### üìà Scalability (–ú–∞—Å—à—Ç–∞–±–∏—Ä—É–µ–º–æ—Å—Ç—å)
**One engine, endless applications.** The architecture is designed for global scalability and adaptability.
*   **Threat Agnostic:** The same core engine that models a flood can be re-tasked to model a fire, a tsunami, or a chemical spill by simply feeding it a different threat model and data set. The three distinct scenarios in this PoC prove this flexibility.
*   **Cloud-Native & API-Driven:** Built on standard, globally available mapping APIs (Google Maps Platform), the system can be deployed anywhere in the world with minimal adaptation.

## 4. How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project-h-time.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-h-time`
3. Since the Google Maps API key is restricted, you must run it on a local server. We recommend using `serve`:
   ```bash
   # Install serve globally (if you haven't already)
   npm install -g serve
   # Run the server
   serve
